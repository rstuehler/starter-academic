Hi, I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Würzburg. My research focuses on the exploration of new materials for spintronic applications and quantum computation. A specific example is the realization of a new phase of matter called *topological insulators*. I advance the fabrication of the one-atom layer thick topological insulator *bismuthene* and study its fundamental quantum mechanical properties with scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy techniques.
